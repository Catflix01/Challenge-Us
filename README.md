People are to comfortable. So… we have have created a website that makes you go outside your comfort zone. We do this by having dares that are posted on the website and you are able to pick from 3 different categories and they are all user friendly and only the admin can add dares, that way we have safe/harmless thing going on.

So the points are based on the difficulty of the challenge. One could be do 10 jumping jacks and another could be go make friends with a stranger and tell us something about them. Point system is changed by difficulty 

Why do we think that people need to be more open?
Well one reason is there are to many people consumed by their phones “id bet if you look around you right now there is going to be someone on there phone”. This is what prompted us, and we even have realised “we” are on our phone to much as well.

The long term mission of this website is to encourage people to go interact and do silly things in public and have fun. This is our little way of making life more enjoyable. 

Why does it matter?
Physical Health: Extended periods of phone use can lead to issues like eye strain, neck and back pain, and headaches. Taking breaks allows for stretching and resting these areas.
Mental health: Constant screens and social media can contribute to feelings of anxiety, stress, and even depression. Stepping away from the phone gives the mind a chance to rest and reset.

Challenges we faced
The hardest part of the compassion was we were using static github server then we wanted to add a propel auth but we couldn't because we had a stactic github server. and we only found that out after we write alllllll of the freaking code. LOL. But at least we learned a lot from it.
